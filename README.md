# plantsharing.de 🌱

Main repository for custom plantsharing.de content:

 - ``locale``:  contains translations of the original karrot landing page. Parts have been adapted to fit [plantsharing.de](plantsharing.de).
 - media (logo, pictures, …) will follow soon


Furthermore:

 - 🥕 plantsharing.de runs its own customized instance of [karrot](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/). It is deliberately not a fork.
 - 💬 to [contact](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/blob/02cb0bb01e46d4815a1267a2c1229ec16ff690af/docs/README.md) us or if you want to [contribute](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md), please just use karrot's communication channels and join ``#plantsharing``.
 - 🚀 also thanks to [uberspace](https://uberspace.de) for many years of amazing service, help, and inspiration!
