# plantsharing.de ðŸŒ±

Main repository for custom plantsharing.de content:

 - contains translations of the karrot landing page. Parts have been adapted to fit [plantsharing.de ðŸŒ±](plantsharing.de).
 - media (bg, fonts, logo, pictures, â€¦)


Furthermore:

 - [plantsharing.de ðŸŒ±](plantsharing.de) runs its own customized instance of [karrot ðŸ¥•](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/). It is deliberately not a fork.
 - to [contact ðŸ’¬](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/blob/02cb0bb01e46d4815a1267a2c1229ec16ff690af/docs/README.md) us, or if you want to [contribute](https://github.com/yunity/karrot-frontend/blob/master/CONTRIBUTE.md), please just use karrot's communication channels and join ``#plantsharing`` and ``#karrot-dev``.
 - thanks to [uberspace ðŸš€](https://uberspace.de) for many years of amazing service, help, and inspiration!
