# The plant-sharing manifesto

Well, not really a [manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifesto).

## Why is plant-sharing and saving a great idea?

 - plants (in general) should be valued and appreciated <3. They deserve our respect and love, simply because they live and exist.
 - like food, their growth and existence consumes resources, also they have an economic value.
 - if you take proper care of your plants, they thank you by being happy and healthy. They enrich our lifes by providing food, by increasing the air quality, or by simply being there.


## Let's do plant-sharing!

 - many of my friends and acquaintances love and collect plants. It also connects over generations: My grandma used to make cuttings (Ableger) of her plants so much that it became kind of a running gag. Even if I didn't share this interest back then, I am treasuring that memory now.
 - it is always fun and fertilizing (befruchtend) to have a warm, small, tight-knit community that shares the same interests
 - perhaps someone who already has experiences with their plant and made a cutting can tell you how to care for it?
 - perhaps it makes you happy to see how your cutting develops in a new home and how many cuttings you shared already?


## Let's do plant-saving!

 - gardening centers have to throw away plants, but are sometimes very critical about that and try to avoid it.
 - however, dumpster diving for plants might not be such a great idea, because they might be infected or otherwise unhealthy. Btw: Isn't that equivalent to dumpster diving food and paying attention to the fact wether it is moldy or not?


## Let's do plant-education!

 - obviously meant to educate people, not plants ;)
 - it can be quite challenging to know what a plant needs and not everyone has a green thumb. Kultivierungsgeschichte.
 - identifying a plant can be difficult. WildkräuterpädagogE/In, HeilpraktikerIn mit entspr. Schwerpunkt, Kräuterspaziergänge, Heilpflanzen, Pilze sammeln, Pflanzenbestimmung (Fdroid: plant.net, YouTube Buschfunkistan), …


## Let's do pro-plant-politics!

 - the fight for free, unpatented, unmodified and stable (FIXME: samenfest) seeds is very important.
